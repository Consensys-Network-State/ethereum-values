                Ethereum is more than a blockchainâ€”it&apos;s a cultural movement
                built on deeply held values which have helped to guide the
                ecosystem and enable it to grow into a global, trustless
                platform for all.
              </p>

                But as Ethereum continues to evolve, so too do the
                interpretations and applications of these core values. As mass
                adoption nears, we need to collectively re-assert the values
                that are important to us as a community.
