  },
  {
    question: "What makes a good value proposal?",
    answer:
      "A good value proposal should be well-articulated, reflect the spirit of Ethereum, and resonate with the community. It should consider both technical and social aspects, while being specific enough to guide decision-making but flexible enough to adapt as the ecosystem evolves.",

  {
    question: "How does the voting process work?",

  {
    question: "Can values be modified after being accepted?",

                Ethereum is more than a blockchainâ€”it&apos;s a cultural movement
                built on deeply held values which have helped to guide the
                ecosystem and enable it to grow into a global, trustless
                platform for all.
              </p>

                But as Ethereum continues to evolve, so too do the
                interpretations and applications of these core values. As mass
                adoption nears, we need to collectively re-assert the values
                that are important to us as a community.
